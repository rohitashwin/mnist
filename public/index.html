    <h1>Handwriting Recognition</h1>
    <p>
      I used PyTorch to train a neural network on the MNIST dataset, to do
      handwritten digit recognition. This was trained on an M1 Macbook Pro using
      Metal Performance Shader device. The training time was around 1 minute on
      the MPS and around 10 minutes on the CPU which is a good improvement.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  The architecture of the neural network is as follows:

	<br>
		Convolutional :: Maxpool :: Convolutional :: Maxpool :: Fully Connected :: Fully Connected :: Softmax
    </p>
    <p>
      Start by clicking and dragging inside the box to draw a digit, and then
      perform handwriting recognition.
